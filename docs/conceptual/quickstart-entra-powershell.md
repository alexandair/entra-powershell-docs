## Prerequisites

Microsoft Entra PowerShell supports two types of authentication: _delegated access_, and _app-only access_. To use Microsoft Entra PowerShell, you need to authenticate to access Microsoft Entra resources. Sign in with an admin account of your tenant, if prompted.

```powershell
Connect-Entra -Scopes 'User.Read.All'

```powershell
Get-Command -Module Microsoft.Graph.Entra
```

```powershell
Get-Help Get-EntraUser -Detailed
```

### Get user information

To retrieve the list of users in Microsoft Entra ID, run the following command.

```powershell
Get-EntraUser
```

This command outputs a list of users in your tenant.

```output
DisplayName           ID                                     Mail                    UserPrincipalName
------------           --                                     ----                    -----------------

```powershell
Get-EntraUser -ObjectId 'aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb'
```

## Data Collection

Microsoft Entra PowerShell collects telemetry data by default. We collection information about the `Microsoft Entra PowerShell version` and the `cmdlet` executed. Microsoft aggregates collected data to identify patterns of usage to identify common issues and to improve the experience of Microsoft Entra PowerShell.
